# Assessing bioinformatics software annotations: bio.tools case-study 

The article [Assessing bioinformatics software annotations: bio.tools case-study](JOBIM2025_submission_219.pdf) has been submitted to jobim 2025. 

This github repository contains the code used in the article to extract metadata from the bio.tools RDF schema, create article figures and calculate tool annotation statistics. 

To load the turtle file and make SPARQL queries on it, a fuseki server is required. If necessary, follow the [Apache Jena Fuseki installation guide](Installation_guide_Fuseki).
